    <p>Welcome to my personal website!</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp I'm a software developer living in the Louisville, KY area.
    Having recently graduated from Indiana University Southeast, 
    I am now employed as an IT Intern at Zirmed's downtown Louisville
     office. </p>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp My computing interests include web applications, OpenGL, learning Linux and
    command line, and many others. When I step away from the computer I'm a gamer,
     basketball coach, martial artist,
    Louisville Cardinal fan, and an avid hip-hop listener.</p>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp Check out the 'Career' page for my resume and a rundown of
    the tools I'm familiar with, as well as the 'Contact' page for ways to track me down!</p>
